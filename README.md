# ProcessMonitor
This project implements a system that monitors currently running processes of a machine. The .Net OWIN system supports multiple clients.
As such, a simple Web Api .Net interface allows different clients to access latest processes' report concurrently.
Also, HTML/Javascript example is provided, which gathers into a table and updates processes' monitoring information via JQuery requests.
Reference: C#, Web Api 2, .Net, Javascript, HTML.
